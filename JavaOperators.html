      <p>Java operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and manipulate the values of the operands. Each operator performs specific operations. Let us consider an expression 5 + 1 = 6; here, 5 and 1 are operands, and the symbol + (plus) is called the operator. We will also learn about operator precedence and operator associativity. </p>
        <div id="lightblue">
             <p>Operators in Java can be categorized based on two criteria:<br>
              <b>* Number of operands</b> – There are three types of operators based on the number of operands. An operator is called a unary, binary, or ternary operator based on the number of operands. If an operator takes one operand, it is called a unary operator; if it takes two operands, it is called a binary operator; if it takes three operands, it is called a ternary operator.<br>
              <b>* Type of operation they perform</b> – An operator is called an arithmetic operator, a relational operator, a logical operator, or a bitwise operator, depending on the kind of operation it performs on its operands.</p>
